Right Click on main directory and create a directory named webapp. Under the webapp create another directory named WEB-INF.

Right click on your Project folder name and click on add framework support and then tick the web and then ok. After 
this you will get a folder named web which contains the web.xml file. Copy
the web.xml file and paste it under your WEB-INF directory and delete the generate web folder.

After this go to your project structure (can be found in the file tab) and go to facets and choose web.

Under the Deployment Descriptors change the path to the newly created web.xml.

Under the Web Resource Directories edit the Web Resource Directory path to point the WEB-INF directory.
